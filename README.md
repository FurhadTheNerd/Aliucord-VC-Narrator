# Aliucord VC Narrator
We all hate the default discord blings and dings and so on, they sound horrible and you can't tell what's happening exactly.
AND THAT'S WHY I MADE VC NARRATOR!
Its a theme that replaces Aliucord's VC sounds to ones that you can actually understand.
For now we only have one voice, but can suggest me more voices to add "or things to do" in the [issues tab!](https://github.com/FurhadTheNerd/Aliucord-VC-Narrator/issues)
# Preview
Male voice Number 1 [we can't embed videos yet, so you'll have to download the preview.](https://github.com/FurhadTheNerd/Aliucord-VC-Narrator/raw/main/preview/Male%201/Male%201.mp4)
# Installion guide
1. download the voice you want from the releases tab (swipe a little bit to the bottom you'll see it)
2. move the latest file you download (the one that ends with .json) to YourPhonesStorage/aliucord/themes
3. open aliucord, and go to the plugins tab and open a plugin called themer, you'll see VC narrator in there, enable it, and enable custom sounds
4. restart aliucord and that's it! enjoy your new humane sounds :3
